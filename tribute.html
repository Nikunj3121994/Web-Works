				<p> It's really sad to see an economic giant leave the EU but oh, well.. What does this mean to the world </p>
				<ul>
					<li> <strong>More expensive foreign holidays </strong> 
						<p class="text-justify">
							The Prime Minister will probably say that the Government stands ready to do whatever it takes to protect the British economy, but there are limits to 
							what it could actually do. George Osborne’s threat to bring in an emergency Budget would probably be downplayed until the effects of the Brexit vote become clearer. 
							The first practical effect of a vote to Leave, therefore, is that the pound will be worth less abroad, meaning foreign holidays will cost us more.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong> No immediate change in immigration status </strong>
						<p class="text-justify">
							The Prime Minister will have to address other immediate concerns. He is likely to reassure nationals of other EU countries living in the UK that their status
							is unchanged. That is what the Leave campaign has said, so, even after the Brexit negotiations are complete, those who are already in the UK would be allowed to stay. As Jon

					</li>
					<li><strong> Higher inflation </strong>
						<p class="text-justify">
							A lower pound means that imports would become more expensive. This is likely to mean the return of inflation – a phenomenon with which many of us are unfamiliar because prices 
							have been stable for so long, rising at no more than about 2 per cent a year.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li> <strong> Interest rates might rise </strong>
						<p class="text-justify">
						The trouble with inflation is that the Bank of England has a legal obligation to keep it as close to 2 per cent a year as possible. If a fall in the pound threatens to push prices up 
						faster than this, the Bank will raise interest rates.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Did somebody say recession? </strong>
						<p class="text-justify">
							Mr Carney, the Treasury and a range of international economists have warned about this. Many Leave voters appear not to have believed them, or to think that they are exaggerating
							small, long-term effects. But there is no doubt that the Leave vote is a negative shock to the economy. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong> And we wouldn’t even get our money back </strong>
						<p class="text-justify">
							All this will be happening while the Prime Minister, whoever he or she is, is negotiating the terms of our future access to the EU single market. In the meantime, our trade with the
							EU would be unaffected, except that companies elsewhere in the EU may be less interested in buying from us or selling to us, expecting tariff barriers to go up in two years’ time.
